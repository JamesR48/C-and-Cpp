Basic notions:
	printf -> goes to the screen. Uses stdout (standard out)
	scanf -> goes to the keyboard. Uses stdin (standard in)

File Redirection (uses a feature of the operating system) ->
	-in the case of printf, instead of going to the screen, the output goes to a file:
		code.exe > file (note the greater than sign >)
	-in this other case, the file provides input into scanf:
		code.exe < file (note the less than sign <)

More advanced:
	printf always has a control string (a quoted string " ") and that gives instructions,
	either verbatim like "hello world", or things with % that do conversion of things that
	occur in a list of comma (,) separated arguments. ("%%"" prints a percentage %)
