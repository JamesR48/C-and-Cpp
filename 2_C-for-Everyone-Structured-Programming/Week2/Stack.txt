Stack: Pila

Stacks are ADTs (Abstract Data Types - aka User-Defined Types)

They're LIFO (Last In, First Out) type, also called canonical non-trivial data structure.
The main actions you can do to this data structure are push (inserting) and pop (extracting).
Other actions include looking at the top, seeing if the stack is empty/full, and resetting the stack.

Implementing stacks in C:
	typedef struct stack
	{
		char s[MAX_LEN];
		int top;
	} stack;
So the underlying representation is an array.

For performing a push:
	//We access the stack through a pointer since the stack is going to be changed
	void push(char c, stack *stk)
	{
		stk -> top++; //Add one to the current top since we are adding a new element to the stack
		stk -> s[stk -> top] = c; //stick in that current top the character "c" we want to add
	}
