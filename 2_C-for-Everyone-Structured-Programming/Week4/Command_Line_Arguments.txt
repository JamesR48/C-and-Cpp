int main() can take 2 special arguments:
	- int argc (argument count)
	- char *argv[] (a series of strings that get stored in a vector)

So argc counts how many things you see in the command line (like the name of the executable)
In the example of the double spacing, we got the name of the double_spaced executable and we processed
2 file names, the inputFileName must be an existing file in the same folder as the code, and the outputFileName
can or cannot exist, in case it doesn't exist it'll be created:
	doubleSpace_CodeExeName inputFileName outputFileName
			argv[0]				argv[1]		  argv[2]
So at the end argc will be = to 3

Inside the code we'll open them like:
	inputFilePtr = fopen(argv[1], "r");
	outputFilePtr = fopen(argv[2], 'w');
